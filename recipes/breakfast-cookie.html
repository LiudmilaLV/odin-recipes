        <h4>Though most people like breakfast, many don’t have the time (or energy) to put together a meal. Instead of skipping your morning meal, try this 5 min breakfast cookie that will satisfy your sweet tooth but also keep you full and energized!</h4>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup oats</li>
            <li>1/2 mashed banana</li>
            <li>3/4 scoop vanilla protein powder</li>
            <li>1-2 tsp brown sugar (you can adjust based on your sweetness preference)</li>
            <li>2 tsp neutral oil</li>
            <li>Sprinkle of cinnamon</li>
            <li>Chocolate chips or raisins (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat air fryer to 325˚F</li>
            <li>Mix together all ingredients except for chocolate chips and raisins</li>
            <li>On a small sheet of parchment paper that can fit into your air fryer, form dough into a ball and press down to make a cookie. Top with chocolate chips or raisins</li>
            <li>Air fry for ~5 min (cooking time may vary depending on your air fryer)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you’re making this in an oven, you can try cooking at 350˚F for ~6 min, but this is just an approximation so cook until the cookie is golden brown!</p>
